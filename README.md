# Cardiovascular Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

Supervised machine learning project to estimate cardiovascular risk using a public Kaggle dataset. The workflow includes data preparation, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

Multiple traditional machine learning models were trained and compared, including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Model performance was evaluated using classification metrics, with a focus on balancing predictive performance and interpretability.

This project was developed as part of the Data Science and Advanced Analytics diploma at UTN.
